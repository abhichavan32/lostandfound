## Database Migration to MySQL

### Prerequisites
1. MySQL Server installed and running
2. Python 3.x installed
3. pip (Python package installer)

### MySQL Server Setup

#### Windows
1. Download and install MySQL Server from the official website
2. During installation:
   - Choose "Server only" or "Custom" installation
   - Set root password to 'root' (for development only)
   - Make sure MySQL service is installed and running
3. Verify MySQL service is running:
   - Open Services (services.msc)
   - Find "MySQL80" or similar
   - Ensure its status is "Running"

#### Troubleshooting MySQL Connection
- If you get connection errors:
  1. Verify MySQL service is running

  3. Verify root password is correct
  4. Try connecting using MySQL Workbench or command line client

### Application Setup

1. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Initialize the database:
```bash
python init_db.py
```
The script will:
- Check MySQL connection (5 attempts)
- Create database if not exists
- Report any connection issues

3. Start the application:
```bash
python app.py
```

### Environment Variables

- `DATABASE_URL`: MySQL connection URL (default: mysql://root:root@localhost/lost_and_found)
- `SESSION_SECRET`: Secret key for session management

### Production Deployment
1. Use strong passwords
2. Set secure environment variables
3. Configure proper MySQL user permissions
4. Enable MySQL security features
5. Regular backups

### Migration Notes
- The application will automatically create all necessary tables when started
- Backup any existing SQLite data before migration
- For production, use environment variables for secure credentials"# lost"
